# Code Challenge

It was built for me to practice front-end development based on an code challenge from [B2W]. You can check out the project over [here](https://wesleyramalho.github.io/code-challenge/ "code challenge"). (https://github.com/b2w-marketplace/code-challenge/ "B2W").

This is the layout of the challenge:
